# hello-mongo

### My first MongoDB-based web service

This is a simple RESTful web service that stores its data in a MongoDB database. It allows the client to perform CRUD operations on a list of servers.

The servers can be managed from an Ember.js-based web interface. See [hello-ember](https://github.com/evanstoner/hello-ember).
